description: "AI-assisted troubleshooting notes and solution writeups"

A collection of short problem/solution writeups written directly by the AI who helped me during the resolution of a problem. Even though I do not write these notes, I always read them before publish. 

You would say **why these writeups?** I store them for the future me, just in case I need to recall how I solved a particular problem. I also try to craft these writeups in order to educate myself.
